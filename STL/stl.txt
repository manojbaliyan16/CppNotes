STL is a collection of liraries that provides templated container algorithm and Iterator
STL Container : 
STL has many different classes which asically falls in to three category 
(1.) Sequence Container: That maintain the odering of the element in the container 
(i) Vector
Example : vectorEx.cpp 
(ii) dequeue Dynamic array which can grow in both direction:
example: 	
(iii) A list is a special type of sequence contianer which is similiar to the double linked list 
(2) Associative Container : 
Associative container are the container which automatically sort the input which input is inserted in to these at any order. Associative container compare the element using operator < 
(a) set: set is a unique container that store unique element, with dublicate element disallowed. The element are stored according to thier values. 
(b) multiset : It is a set where duplicate elements are allowed.
(c) Map is an Associative container is called associative array where each element is a pair with key value pair, The key is used for sortinf and storing the data, the value is the actual data.


Container Adapter: 
Container Adapter are special type of container which can be used in the form of any associative container they are like 
STACK 
queue 
Priority Queue
STL iterator: 
An Iterator is an Object which can traverse over a container class without the user having to know how it is implemented.
Each Iterator having for basic memeber function 
begin(): Returns an iterator that representing begning of the element in to container
end(): 
cbegin():returns the const iterator 	
cend()
Finally are container provides two types of the iterator:
container::iterator provides a read/write 	iterator
container :: const-iterator provides read only iterator
STL algorithms : 
STL also provides a  number of algorithms like search, sort, traversing, reverse, insert etc.
